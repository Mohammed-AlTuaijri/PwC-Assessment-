Read open data policy of Ministry of Finance .
What is open government data?
Government data that is freely available for anyone to use, reuse, distribute or share with others without restrictions is called open government data. As per the UN eGovernment Survey 2018 (PDF, 2 MB) , open government data is government information proactively disclosed and made available online for all to access, without restriction.

Benefits of open government data
Disclosing government data brings transparency in government transactions and makes them accountable for their actions. It facilitates public scrutiny and evaluation of government performance. Open data helps in efficient use of resources, designing customised service delivery and creation of more jobs. It helps people to make informed decisions about public policies and identify development opportunities. Through all its endeavours, open government data helps to achieve the SDGs .

A document issued by World Bank (PDF, 1.5 MB) estimates the direct, annual economic value of open government data in two different studies as up to 40 billion euros throughout the European Union and close to 2 billion pounds in the UK.

Increasingly many countries have launched an open data portal. In 2014, just 46 countries had an open data portal. However, in 2018, 139 countries had an open data portal as per the UN eGovernment Survey 2018.
The UAE has two data portals: UAE Numbers and Bayanat .

The World Bank document brings out the key benefits of open data which are:
Open data can promote economic growth by helping launch new businesses, create new jobs, increase efficiency in existing organisations and generally improve the climate for foreign investment.

Open data can help strengthen healthcare systems by connecting patients to providers, promote education and ongoing learning, and relieve hunger and improve food security on both a large and small scale.

Open data can expose and prevent mismanagement and corruption. It also helps ensure environmental sustainability through transparent data that can help reduce pollution, conserve natural resources, and build resilience to climate change.

Open data can help improve cities and urban infrastructure. It is key to high-tech smart cities, modern urban planning and the transformation of urban transportation. It can also improve resilience to disasters and ensure that critical resources will be deployed well in emergencies.

Quarantine is a precautionary measure taken to stop the spread of a contagious disease. The UAE Government advises quarantining to those who may have been in contact with someone infected with COVID-19. Violating home quarantine procedures is an act punishable by law.
Quarantine is a precautionary measure taken to stop the spread of a contagious disease. It involves restricting the movement of healthy people who may have been exposed to a communicable disease. People would be confined t o a house or a hotel and be away from others for a certain period of time, usually 14 days in the case of COVID-19, in order to ensure that they are free of the disease.
Isolation is the separation of ill persons who have a communicable disease from those who are healthy, so that they do not infect others.

As of 25 March 2022, quarantine is not required for those who came in close contact with a positive case of COVID-19. However, they must undergo an RT-PCR test on day one and seven , or when the contact starts showing symptoms of COVID-19.

However, each emirate has the flexibility to determine the duration of the quarantine period and the number and the duration within which RT-PCR tests need to be done.

The TraceCovid app detects other devices that have the same app and shares proximity data with it. When two users who have installed the TraceCovid app come in contact with one another, a ‘Secure Tracing Identifier’ (STI) is exchanged and stored in their respective phones. This STI list contains the records of individuals that a user had close contact with. If one of the users is infected with the virus, the relevant authorities will be able to access the user’s data and timestamp and reach out to possibly infected individuals easily.

Hence, the app helps in tracking COVID-19 cases by auto-recording all the people who had been near a COVID-19 patient, including those that might not be known to the patient. The app functions on Bluetooth-enabled smartphones. The Bluetooth feature must remain active at all times for the application to read and determine the user’s exact location.

The TraceCovid app is launched by Department of Health - Abu Dhabi (DoH) and is available on App Store.
The StayHome app ensures that people directed to self-quarantine are complying with the mandatory quarantine requirements. Through the app, a quarantined person can share his self-quarantine status and his location with Department of Health - Abu Dhabi (DoH). DoH can send alerts to quarantined people to stay within the range of movement allowed during the quarantine period.

When a person is identified for home quarantine, DoH will advise him to download the StayHome app from Google Play or Apple Store. DoH will then issue him a username and password to use the app. The quarantined person must enable the app’s access to camera, media, location, audio and calls for the app to work effectively. DoH will periodically send notifications to the quarantined person asking him to check in to his location then. The person has to take a photo of himself to finalise the check in.

In June 2020, the UAE commenced phase-III of clinical trial of inactivated COVID-19 vaccine. The clinical trial process is usually divided in three phases. Phase-I mainly looks into the safety of the vaccine. Phase-II evaluates the immunogenicity and explores the immunisation process in a limited number of individuals. Phase-III considers the safety and effectiveness of the vaccine in a larger population sample. If a vaccine is confirmed to be safe and effective throughout the entire clinical trial process, the test is considered successful, and the vaccine enters the large-scale manufacturing phase.

The inactivated COVID-19 vaccine passed phases I and II of clinical trials without showing any serious adverse reactions. All volunteers of the clinical trials generated antibodies after two doses in 28 days.

Sinopharm China National Biotec Group (CNBG), a Chinese pharmaceutical company and Group 42 (G42), an artificial intelligence and cloud computing company based in Abu Dhabi signed a clinical cooperation agreement. G42 will lead the clinical trial operations in the UAE under the supervision of Department of Health - Abu Dhabi . A safe and effective vaccine could enter the market by the end of 2020 or early 2021 and relieve mankind of COVID-19.

As per information on 16 July 2020, very soon, Abu Dhabi will host the world’s first global clinical phase-III trials of COVID-19 inactivated vaccine enlisted by World Health Organisation (WHO). The UAE requested interested volunteers to register themselves for these trials through the 4humanity website. Read more on ' Volunteering for phase-III of clinical trial of COVID-19 vaccine '.

What is mediation and who does it? How does the UAE’s legal system support mediation? Find out.
Mediation is a voluntary and an alternative method for resolving civil and commercial disputes that have arisen or may arise between parties in a legal relationship, irrespective of whether it is based on a contract. In mediation, the parties seek the help of an impartial third party, known as the mediator. Mediation process is conducted within a judicial or a non-judicial context. (Reference is Federal Law No.6 of 2021 below).

Mediation is governed by the F ederal Decree Law No. 40 of 2023on Mediation and Conciliation in Civil and Commercial Disputes (in Arabic, PDF 372 KB). The law introduces a framework in which mediation can occur in the UAE and sets out the obligations of the mediators and all parties involved.

Wasata is an eMediation platform , launched by Ministry of Justice to offer an online alternative to the traditional litigation process. This platform is designed to facilitate the resolution of civil and commercial disputes by connecting users with registered mediators who specialise in conducting proceedings in either Arabic or English.

The platform encompasses a comprehensive set of procedures, including mediator’s registration, renewal and delisting, along with procedures for both, non-judicial and judicial mediation. It manages mediator-related tasks, requests and sessions, facilitates the payment of mediation expenses and mediator's fees, and helps in the preparation of the final mediation report.

The purpose of this platform is to expedite the resolution of disputes, while reducing the burden on the courts’ systems.

In 2022, the utilisation of alternative dispute resolution (ADR) methods for civil and commercial disputes resulted in a settlement rate of 61.3 per cent.

With the digital transformation of the justice system in the UAE, pleadings can be made remotely, 24/7. Read about the virtual digital pleadings.
The ‘ Virtual digital pleading’ enables litigants in a lawsuit to submit their statements and requests before the courts using digital channels without any limitations of location or time.

The service facilitates the plaintiff to access the system and record his/her statements and requests in the lawsuit, and at the same time, enables the defendant to respond to these requests under the supervision of the competent judge or case manager. Both parties can exchange requests and responses throughout the designated session day.

The platform provides a virtual environment that meets the needs of litigants and lawyers, offering fast, efficient, transparent and advanced justice, 24/7.

The pleading process involves a back-and-forth exchange between the two parties of the case, where they present their defences, arguments, evidence and requests using memoranda, documents, previous judicial rulings and evidence.

Previously, the process of appearing before a judge for litigation took place either in person or virtually, with sessions scheduled in advance. However, this approach demanded considerable time, effort and procedural requirements from the parties involved. With the introduction of the ‘Virtual digital pleading’, the pleading has changed into an instant conversation format between the parties involved. This conversation occurs directly, with their statements being recorded and documented in the digital pleading minutes and the digital case record.

The service can be accessed and the digital pleading minutes can be viewed via smart phones or the website round the clock so that the lawsuit parties can add any new evidence or document when they want. This accelerates the pace of litigation, shortens many procedures and contributes to achieving rapid and prompt justice.

This service is in line with the UAE Strategy for Government Services , which aims to facilitate digital transformation and provide the best government services in the world.

Popular searchesThis page covers the procedure of filing and fighting a criminal case.
The Federal Law No. 35 of 1992 as amended , specifies the procedures for criminal cases in the UAE. It comprises a set of rules that describe the methodology and procedures for criminal investigation, the trial of accused, rendering judgement, conditions for appealing judgement at upper courts and the enforcement of judgement.

As per Article 7 of the Criminal Procedures Law , as amended, Public Prosecution has exclusive jurisdiction to initiate and prosecute criminal proceedings. It also has the authority to track it until a final judgement is rendered.

Public Prosecution is part of the judicial body. It assumes the authority of investigation and imposing charges, as well as referring the accused person to the competent court if his involvement in the crime is proven.

It also undertakes issues regarding the surrender of criminals and its follow-up in accordance with the international conventions, in cooperation with International Criminal Police.

However, in some cases as listed in Article 10 of the same Law, written or verbal complaint by the victim or his legal representative are necessary for filing a criminal action. These instances include:

Provided, in the above cases the complaint will not be accepted after three months since the victim knew about the crime and the party who committed a crime, unless otherwise provided by the law.

If the accused was caught red-handed, the complaint may be submitted to any public authority officer (i.e. police officer) attending the scene of the incident.

If there is more than one victim in the crime, a complaint from one of them is enough to initiate a criminal action.

If more than one person was accused of a crime, and the complaint was filed against one of them, it also applies to the other accused.

Where the victims are less than 15 years old or mentally challenged, or if the crime was committed against their property, the complaint shall be submitted by their legal guardian.
In case of a conflict of interest between the victim and his representative or if the victim has nobody to represent him, the public prosecutor will act for him.
The public prosecution carries out the investigation in Arabic.

In case the accused, the litigating parties, the witnesses or others whose statements are deemed critical by the public prosecutor do not know Arabic, the prosecution may seek the help of an interpreter after taking the oath.
A criminal action lapses if the victim withdraws his complaint. In case there are multiple victims, a criminal action would lapse when all victims who submitted the complaint withdraw the complaint.
In criminal cases where more than one person is accused, withdrawal of the complaint against one of them takes effect for the others as well.
If the victim dies after submitting a complaint, the right of withdrawal passes to his legal heirs.
The criminal case also lapses with the death of the accused, issuance of a final judgement, withdrawal of legal action by the party which has the right to do so, issuance of an amnesty or repeal of the law which penalises such acts.
Criminal cases also lapse after 20 years in felonies (serious crimes) punished by death sentences, 10 years in all other felonies, 3 years in misdemeanour and 1 year in violations.

Judicial officers from different government departments have the authority to inspect crimes and collect evidence. These include judicial officers from the Police Department, the Public Prosecution and the Criminal Courts.

The role of police is to safeguard the public, take initial statements from complainants and witnesses, arrest suspects, carry out investigations and execute orders from the Public Prosecution to assist in the investigation process.
Criminal actions in the UAE commence with filing a complaint with the local police in the jurisdiction where the offence was committed.
During the investigation, police may take the statements of any parties involved. Local police usually refer the matter to the prosecutor's office within 48 hours of the filing of the complaint.
The Public Prosecution should question the accused within 24 hours and then order either his arrest or release as per Article 47 of the law.
The UAE's judicial system respects the dignity of people. The criminal procedural law presumes that an accused is innocent until proven guilty. Therefore, it observes certain procedures when dealing with criminal cases. They are:
Anyone accused of a felony (or a serious crime) punishable by a death sentence or life imprisonment may have a lawyer to defend him at the trial stage.
If the accused did not appoint a lawyer, the court shall provide him with a lawyer whose fees are to be incurred by the state, as provided by the law.
The accused in a felony punished by provisional imprisonment may also ask the court to provide him with an attorney in his defence, after verifying his financial inability to hire a lawyer.
The judicial officer, upon his arrival at the crime scene (or where a person is caught red-handed) shall prevent people present at the scene from leaving it or going away until a report is drafted. The officer can also immediately call upon anyone who may have any clarification about the incident to give his statement.
The judicial officer may order the arrest of the accused present at the scene of the incident with sufficient evidence of his perpetration of the crime under the circumstances mentioned in Article 45 of the law.
If the accused is not present, the judicial officer may issue an arrest warrant, which has to be stated in the report. The arrest warrant should be enforced by one of the public authority officers.
The judicial officer should hear the statements of the accused immediately after his arrest. If the accused does not present anything that substantiates his innocence, he should be sent to the relevant public prosecution within 48 hours. The Public Prosecution shall question him within 24 hours and then order either his arrest or release.
The judicial officer may search the accused under circumstances where his arrest is allowed as per the law and the accused may be frisked for what might be on his body, clothes or belongings from the things related to the crime or required for the investigation.
If the accused is a female, a female assigned by the judicial officer should carry out the search after taking an oath. The witnesses attending the inspection should also be females.
Defendant's home may not be searched without a search warrant from the public prosecution unless the defendant was caught red-handed and with strong hints that the defendant was hiding in his house such objects or papers which might uncover the truth.
The search and the seizure of objects and papers should be carried out in the manner specified by the law.

Food safety is an essential element of food security, especially in the UAE, which depends on imports for meeting a large part of its food needs. The UAE took the following measures to ensure food safety.
In January 2016, the late H. H. Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan approved the Federal Law No. 10 of 2015 on Food Safety (PDF, 250 KB) . The law imposes standards and regulations for maintaining the safety and quality of food and ensuring the protection of public health and consumers. The law imposes strict penalties on those found to be endangering food safety across the UAE. Some aspects of the food law are:

The law authorises Ministry of Economy to impose fines of up to AED 100,000 for other offences, provided that these offences are regulated by the Cabinet. Through its National Food Safety Committee, the Ministry of Climate Change & Environment works with its partners on implementing the law on safety of food and its executive regulations, which includes strict controls and standards to ensure food safety throughout the food chain.
A per the Ministerial Decree No. 239 of 2018 on National Food Accreditation and Registration System (250 KB, PDF in Arabic), food whether imported or locally produced or modified on its food label or ingredients or composition must be registered in the electronic system (ZAD) , which is an integrated smart platform for food products data , before being handled in the UAE’s markets.
The National Rapid Alert System for Food was launched in 2017 to ensure proper implementation of response measures when serious food risks are detected. The system identifies the mechanisms of managing food risk alerts as well as banning and lifting of bans on adulterated and misbranded food.

The components of the system include: assignment of responsibilities and roles, identifying types of food alerts, identifying the criteria to report food incidents, including border rejection of food and adulterated products in the market. The system applies a classification matrix to the food incidents as either high, medium or low. It also includes the triggers for the classification, namely the severity of risk to public health, the size and scale of an incident and the number of people affected by it.
According to Ministerial Decree No. 14 of 2016 on Controlling of Imported Food for Non-trading Purpose (300 KB, PDF in Arabic), personal food is allowed to be imported through the country’s borders with a restriction on specific types and quantities.Food packages should have clear and non-removable labels that include the names of stakeholders except for the food which passengers bring. Imported food should enclose documents issued by the carrier in the country of origin. The documents must have full details of the imported foods .

The UAE Government sees young people as its greatest assets; the foundation of the country’s future. In 2016, H. H. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Prime Minister and Vice President of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, committed to putting young people’s needs and desires at the fore, by creating the position of Minister of State for Youth Affairs – a dedicated post that showed the government’s confidence in young people’s capabilities.

This enabled the youth to shoulder national responsibilities, innovate and contribute to the welfare of the UAE's community. To achieve its vi sion, the UAE needs the skills, energy, enthusiasm and commitment of the country's young people, and to do that, young people’s voices must be heard, their ideas taken on, and their recommendations implemented at all government levels.

The government took seriously the potential advantages of harnessing the ‘youth bulge’ in the UAE and in the region, appointing one of the youngest ministers in the world, nominated by universities from across the country. To place a young person at the helm of such an important government department was a vote of confidence in this generation’s ability to lead effectively.
Interactive Youth Lab is an innovative initiative aimed at activating the role of youth and investing their creative potential in discovering solutions and ideas for the development of government initiatives and the work of the mGovernment sector. The lab aims to enhance the role of young people and their place in decision-making and policy development, all in an interactive way.

Students of Khalifa University in Abu Dhabi, members of the Abu Dhabi Youth Council and a distinguished group of Emirati youth participated in this lab which was launched in February 2019 by Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority (TDRA).
In 2018, Federal Youth Authority (FYA) was established. It was a startup initiative intended to connect every young person to every branch of government. It followed the principle of ‘Done by Youth, For Youth and With Youth’. This paved the way to make youth strategy and policy, a part of all public and private sectors.
The UAE’s National Youth Strategy looks at the five major transitions in a youth’s life in a 20-year span.
From ages 15-35, youth transition through these critical stages:
FYA invests in youth’s energy, our most valuable resource, by nurturing their character , developing an enabling environment for their growth and development, and maximising their participation .
FYA uses the metaphor of a plant to illustrate their strategy:
The UAE Government designed many policies to make the youth take part in every sector and at all levels of governance and decision-making, and to infuse them into the national strategy as key stakeholders and actors in the country’s development.
Youth Engagement Policy
The UAE’s mandate is to institutionalise the whole youth sector. The UAE has made big bets on youth and believes that engaging them is the fundamental component to success in the next 50 years of development.

FYA is therefore part of spearheading the Engagement policy to include the voice of the youth in everything we do. Engaging youth means three core things:

The UAE engages youth at regional (through the Arab Youth Centre), national and local levels. It engages its youth in all matters, and it can be evidenced in the policies and initiatives below.
Emirati Youth Board Membership
In June 2019, the UAE Cabinet made it mandatory for federal government entities to include young Emiratis (under 30 years old) in the Boards of Directors of their respective entities . It launched an electronic platform for those interested to register and apply to these boards, and on 3rd February 2020, Cabinet approved the appointment of 33 applicants as members of the Boards of Directors for key federal entities.

The young board members serve two to three-year terms and undergo intensive training. They enjoy similar privileges and benefits as other established board members. The new members are expected to provide creative solutions for national issues and to ensure that youth are given opportunities and that their challenges are resolved at every level.

Youth Councils
In 2017, the UAE government developed Youth Councils as a unique tool to ensure that the youth represent their points of view and needs at all stages of the policy development process.

Youth Councils were launched with an aim to nurture young leaders by giving them a key role in decision-making and in the development of policies and projects. They provide a platform for youth to lead projects in their field or their emirate.The ecosystem of the Youth Councils is crucial to implementing and executing the UAE’s National Youth Strategy.

There are five Youth Councils which serve as the central form of volunteer governance over many of the Youth initiatives and points of engagement:
● Emirates Youth Council (EYC)
● Local Youth Councils (LYC)
● Global Youth Councils (GYC)
● Inter-Ministerial Councils (IMC)
These function as the representative arms of youth across the UAE’s specific ministries.

● Corporate Councils
These function as the representative arms of youth across the UAE’s private and public sector enterprises.

The Youth Housing Policy
On 2 June2020, the UAE Cabinet approved the Youth Housing Awareness Policy to raise youth awareness and provide them with a host of information on the various phases of housing construction.

The policy requires all young applicants (from 18 to 35 years) to complete a training course on the foundations of housing construction as a main requirement to apply for housing assistance at the local and federal level in the UAE.

Federal Youth Authority also developed a ‘ Housing 101 ’ course, which provides instructions on the how to build a house – from conception to construction.

Youth Circles
Designed by and for the youth, Youth Circles provide two-way dialogues directly between the youth and our government, private sector and global leaders.

Youth Circles are affordable, accessible and fully community-led. Organised periodically throughout different globallocations, the aim of Youth Circles is to develop practical solutions, innovative ideas and effective policies and tangibly connect Youth to leadership.

In Youth Circles, youth share their ideas, needs, challenges and dreams. Leaders listen, hold a dialogue and take action. Each event addresses a specific topic and the young participants try to come up with solutions and ideas through discussions and recommendations.

Youth Hubs
Youth Hubs are state-of-the-art spaces done by the youth, for the youth. They are collaborative work and convening spaces that connect young people throughout the UAE with the essential resources and ecosystem for growth.

The mission of Youth Hub is to provide world-class resources for the youth to explore their purpose in life and pursue their potential and thrive. Resources include both, facilities and courses in various skills designed to bring out their potential.
Youth Hubs are located across all the UAE and are open to young people between 15 and 35 years irrespective of whether they are students, employees or entrepreneurs.

The first Youth Hub opened in Dubai in September 2017 in order to connect youth in the areas of:

There are currently 13 Youth Hubs around the UAE. Each Youth Hub is distinctly designed to serve the youth of that emirate, accommodating their needs and aspirations.

In 2017, the UAE launched the Arab Youth Center (AYC) during the World Government Summit 2017. AYC is a regional youth centre in the UAE that helps to develop youth capabilities and supports innovation and creativity in the Arab world. It implements initiatives across different sectors, and conducts research amongst young Arabs to help decision-makers shape youth-friendly policies.

AYC runs over 25 initiatives every year, connecting the youth to industry professionals, opening doors for them in the academic world, helping them build their businesses and much more.

For the ninth year in a row, the UAE is the Arab youth's first choice for living, according to the Arab Youth Survey 2020. The UAE recognises the importance of equipping not just its own youth, but also the youth within the region. The success of the region lies in its youth, and the UAE is working closely with young Arabs to make sure their contributions to their countries have a ripple effect across borders and well into the future.

Popular searchesDivorce is an increasing social concern in the UAE. This page provides information about the divorce laws for Muslims and non-Muslims in the UAE and steps to follow for applying for divorce.
Islamic marriages are governed by the Sharia law. If both husband and wife are Muslims and residents in the UAE, Sharia/UAE law will most likely be applied to their divorce. The same is likely if the husband is a Muslim and the woman a non-Muslim.
The first step is to register the case by either party at the Family Guidance Section at the respective judicial department, in one of the emirates. A court appointed conciliator will try to reconcile the divorcing parties.
The conciliatory procedure is a mandatory process of the divorce proceedings in the UAE. Parties are allowed to raise their concerns pertaining to the marriage in the absence of their respective legal representatives.
Amicable divorces can be concluded at this stage. Parties will need to draft a settlement based on the parties’ mutual understanding and sign it before the conciliator.

If one of the parties or both of them are determined about the divorce, then the conciliator will provide the claimant with a referral letter, permitting them to proceed before the court to conclude their divorce case.
The letter can be submitted to court at any time within three months from the date of issue. Once in court, the particulars of the divorce case fall at the court's discretion and each party has to provide evidence to support own claims against one another as well as in their own defence.
Non-Muslim expatriate residents can file for divorce in their home country (domicile) or apply for divorce in the UAE.
If the parties wish to have the law of their home country applied, they may petition for this before the court. Article 1 of the Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs , as amendedstates: The provisions of this Law shall apply on citizens of the United Arab Emirates State unless non-Muslims among them have special provisions applicable to their community or confession. They shall equally apply to non-citizens unless one of them asks for the application of his law. This means that relevant parties may ask to apply their own laws to personal status matters.
It also provides: The law of the state of which the husband is a national at the time the marriage is contracted shall apply to the effects on personal status and the effects with regards to property resulting from contracting of the marriage.
Whenever the law of the parties' home country fails to cover an aspect of the divorce procedure, the courts hold discretion to apply the UAE law.
According to  Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs, the biological mother of the child is the custodian and the father is the guardian. Custody involves day-to-day care of the child, which is usually granted to the mother without interfering with the right of guardianship awarded to the father.
At all times, the father is responsible for providing for the child financially. He is responsible for providing shelter, expenses for food, medical care, education and other necessities.
Custody and guardianship are two separate issues that must be addressed individually as parents do not share equal responsibilities for a child in the UAE.

The courts always act in the best interests of the child and therefore, unless given reason to believe otherwise, they keep him in the physical custody of the mother, whilst being under the guardian's (father's) supervision.
Article 156 of  Federal Law No 28 of 2005 for Personal Affairs  provides that a child's custody under the mother ends when their son reaches the age of 11 and when their daughter reaches the age of 13. The father being the guardian can claim the custody thereafter.
As set out in Article 143 and 144 of the law, a custodian must be:
If the custodian is the mother, she must:
If the custodian is the father, he must:
The mother also has the right to claim the extension of the custody period until their son finishes his education and their daughter gets married. In this case, the mother has to prove that she has been good with the children i.e. through their school performance reports, good medical health history etc.
The father can claim the custody of their son if he feels that their son is becoming too soft in nature by staying with the mother and that he would want him to grow up to be more responsible. In both circumstances, the judge will decide the case.
A custodian cannot travel with the child without the guardian's approval and vice-versa. Fleeing with the child without the consent of the other parent, could amount to child abduction. The parent abducting the child can face serious legal consequences for such action. If either parent has concerns, they can obtain a travel ban preventing the child from leaving the airport. If there is a dispute, the matter can be referred to a judge.

National Charter for Happiness
On 20 March 2016, Sheikh Mohammed approved  National Programme for Happiness    which will serve as National Charter for Happiness . He also approved several initiatives that aim to create happy and productive work environment at federal government offices.
Some of the initiatives are:

Appointing CEOs for happiness
The competent minister or the board chairman will appoint CEOs of happiness and wellbeing, with a view to enhance the culture of happiness and wellbeing. The CEO will coordinate with the Ministry of Community Development to implement initiatives of the National Programme of Happiness and wellbeing in government entities.
The CEO will also manage and coordinate initiatives and projects to promote happiness and wellbeing among staff and customers, as well as launching programs to classify the work environment in the public and private sectors according to their levels of happiness.

Establishing councils for happiness and wellbeing at federal entities
The council for happiness and wellbeing will include representatives of various sectors and areas. It aims to ensure that all plans and services follow a unified approach to realise happiness and wellbeing.

Allocating time in federal entities for happiness-related programmes and activities
These activities aim at instilling happiness and wellbeing culture inside the federal government entity or outside to ensure community happiness.

Customer Happiness Formula
On 10 May 2016, Her Excellency Ohood bint Khalfan Al Roumi unveiled Customer Happiness Formula . The formula aims to provide an effective tool for government employees to achieve the happiness goals under National Programme for Happiness and wellbeing. The launch of the Customer Happiness Formula highlights the government's commitment to provide services that achieve customer happiness and ensure the happiness of the entire community.
The formula consists of three main components:

Training for Chief Happiness and wellbeing Officers
In July 2016, the UAE Government announced that 60 Chief Happiness and wellbeing Officers from federal and local government entities will undergo  training to understand the 'science of happiness' and implement  it. The training programme consists of five pillars which are:
The programme includes lectures, seminars, educational benchmarking visits to see the best global practices and experiences in the field and a set of applications and workshops. The programme will be implemented from September 2016 to January 2017. The Chief Happiness and wellbeing Officers will design and implement projects to promote happiness and wellbeing in government departments and society.

Friends of Happiness Platform
On April 2017, the National Programme for Happiness and Wellbeinglaunched the ‘ Friends of Happiness’ platform , an electronic portal that seeks to encourage public involvement in the programme’s initiatives and to rally support for the government’s efforts to promote happiness and wellbeing.
The initiative seeks to spread awareness about the importance of happiness and wellbeing, as well as to establish partnerships between the government and the community, individuals and organisations that endorse happiness as a practice in all sectors and support the government’s projects during the ’ Year of Giving.’

Happiness Research Institute
On March 2017, The UAE University (UAEU) in collaboration with the National Programme for Happiness and wellbeing established Emirates Center for Happiness Research , the first of its kind in the UAE and the Middle East.
The Center aims to realise the objectives of the National Programme for Happiness and wellbeing and conduct specialised scientific studies related to the science of happiness, and measuring and assessing happiness indices. It also aims to enhance the UAE’s contribution to enriching the scientific content of happiness at the global level.
Wellbeing Academy is a virtual academy that aims to offer programmes to federal and local government entities on how to integrate the principles of well-being into their programmes, initiatives, policies and services. It also aims to promote personal well-being.


Wellbeing Academy was launched to implement the pillars of National Strategy for Wellbeing 2031 . It is built on six practical pillars for integrating the concept of well-being into government work. The pillars are:

The academy’s training courses include specialised programmes and courses on well-being in government work, well-being at the workplace, introductory seminars on well-being, open-source online courses and interactive sessions with experts.

The programmes at Wellbeing Academy include remote interactive meetings with a selection of elite international speakers from various disciplines and fields related to well-being in government. The programmes also include interaction for exchanging experience and best practices, which would provide the employees of the UAE Government the skills for enhancing efficiency and improving the workplace environment.

The academy's programmes are designed in collaboration with top national and international experts and in partnership with prestigious international institutions such as The Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Columbia University , Harvard Business Review and The What Works Network .
National Programme for Happiness and Well-Being launched a Guide to Happiness and Well-being at workplace.

The purpose of the guide is to help government entities and other stakeholders in the private sector and non-profit organisations discover how to foster the conditions necessary for employees to thrive and flourish at work in terms of productivity and engagement.

The employee’s happiness at workplace is critical because it is often directly reflected in the quality and volume of services an institution offers to its customers.

An emphasis on happiness and well-being raises morale across an organisation, boosts engagement at work and builds trust and loyalty among colleagues and between the employees and the institution itself.

The guide outlines four fundamental pillars that underpin the development of a positive workplace culture which is supportive of happiness and wellbeing. Read about the Guide to Happiness and Well-being at workplace.

In doing so, it wants to ensure a better future for the Internet sector and an uninterrupted provision of digital services. Hence, it is formulating best strategies to adopt Internet Protocol 6.0 (IPV6), which is essential for technological progress in this era.
The UAE is heading towards applying the concept of smart cities and the increasing emerging technologies such as big data, the Internet, cloud services and others.
Accordingly, the UAE digital government is setting plans and future strategies to adopt the internet protocol 6.0 (IPV6). This version is expected to make a big change in the digital world with its high security and capacity features that will meet the increasing growth of the internet usage and IP addresses. As the IPV6 is seen as a major solution for the challenges resulting from Internet Protocol 4.0, this new protocol will keep the UAE ahead of the latest technologies in the race towards digital transformation and uninterrupted provision of services.
Telecommunications and Digital Government Regulatory Authority -TDRA organizes extensive workshops in collaboration with government and private entities, at the local and international level, to discuss special technicalities of working with IPV6, the current situation and the basic requirements for building a comprehensive system.
In addition, TDRA is collaborating with both Etisalat and du, the internet service providers in the UAE, and with the local eGovernments to develop the telecommunications sector and spread the usage of IPV6 on their networks in the country, which have a prominent impact on the economic and social growth. TDRA, represented by the .ae Domain Administration Department established the UAE top-level domain infrastructure to comply with the IPv6.

The UAE Digital Government Online Service Index (DGOSI) was developed as a comprehensive evaluation tool to assess the digital services provided by the federal government entities in the UAE.

UAE Digital Government Online Service Index Framework
The framework for the UAE Digital Government Online Service Index consists of 50 criteria designed to evaluate the quality of digital services. Additionally, it includes 24 criteria that assess the extent of digital participation and open data, ensuring full alignment with the online services index. UAE Digital Government Online Service Index consists of the following two main indicators:

The DSQI assesses the level of digitisation and quality of government services. It provides a measurement for each digital service offered by a government entity. The primary focus of the DSQI is to evaluate the effectiveness and efficiency of government digital services that are intended for use by individuals, businesses and other government entities.

DSQI consists of 8 criteria (called measures) for a service. Each criteria has further sub-criteria. The table below demonstrates service measures and their definitions.


A separate assessment is conducted at the organisational level to measure digital participation and open data and their compliance with the OSI requirements. DPOD index measures the status and achievements of digital participation and open data in a government entity. The index consists of two measures for the entity and each measure has its own individual criteria:

It measures publication of required documentation about open data and the publication of required information about open data

Assessment scope
The assessment covers four categories of services. The following table demonstrates the categories and scope of these services:

Categories of services
Scope

Air Quality Index (AQI) is an Artificial Intelligence-based platform that displays accurate real-time air quality readings based on satellite data. AQI monitors and analyses air quality and produces calculated forecasts to drive data-informed decision-making and strategies that reduce air pollution.

AQI forecasts the air quality status for up to three days in advance and predicts the concentration of dust and particulate matters with a diameter of less than 2.5 microns. AQI calculations are based on the measurements of five main pollutants:
The National Air Quality Platform uses the Air Quality Index (AQI) platform to provide real-time data on the quality of the air in the UAE. It displays information received from 31 air pollution monitoring stations across the UAE. You can check the air quality in each area, learn about the health risks associated with each level of air quality and decide if a certain area is suitable to visit depending on the quality of air.

National Center of Meteorology shares the information on air quality with the authorities to help them develop policies on air pollution control. This information enables researchers and academicians to study the impact of environmental factors, industrial progress and population density on air quality.

Popular searchesThe UAE has a varied topography with sand dunes, oases, rocky mountains, valleys, marshes and mangroves and salt plains. Its ecosystem is as varied. Read about it all on this page.
In July 2018, Ministry of Climate Change and Environment (MOCCAE) launched a three-phase national project titled ‘The UAE’s Natural Wonders’. The first phase of the project raises awareness about the UAE’s 43 nature reserves, which make up 14 per cent of the UAE’s territory. Read on .
The UAE is largely an arid land with vast sand deserts, but is also characterised by sand dunes, oases, rock mountains, valleys, marshes and mangroves and salt plains.
The oases are mostly of date palms; most oases are located in the emirate of Abu Dhabi.
Along the eastern borders are the Hajjar Mountains that run north-south. These mountains are complemented by valleys (called wadis in Arabic). The wadis are usually dry. However, in cooler months when it rains, they flourish with brooks and pools.
Mangroves (called qurms in Arabic) form an integral part of the marine ecosystem.
Salt plains (called sabkhas in Arabic) are also a common feature. The present-day sabkha started to form some 4000 years ago.
The UAE's natural environment is diverse with four major varieties of ecosystems:

Desert ecosystem
Desert is the dominating landscape, stretching from the southern coast of Arabian Gulf to the uninhabited sands of the Empty Quarter (Rub Al Khali). To the east is the gravel plains bordering the  Hajjar Mountains.

Mountains ecosystem
Hajjar's rugged mountains rise sharply to an elevation of 2000 metres. Wadis or dry riverbeds open out onto fertile plains.

Coastal and marine ecosystem
The UAE's seas are home to a variety of fish, invertebrates and other marine animals. The southwest waters of Abu Dhabi and Marawah Marine Biosphere Reserve in Abu Dhabi, Jebel Ali in Dubai and Sir Bu Na'air Island and Khor Kalba in Sharjah are recognised by the UAE for their rich and unique environmental biodiversity and are of global biological and ecological importance. The marine habitat protects beaches from coastal erosion and plays a role in climate change mitigation.
Natural habitats of marine organisms are governed mostlyby the type of surface, tides, water current, degree of wave exposure, temperature and salinity.
The marine life of the UAE is rich in fish, plants and corals. Over 500 different species of fish inhabit the Gulf waters, with many more existing in the Indian Ocean.
The Arabian Gulf is blessed with large populations of dugongs, dolphins (eight species) and marine turtles. The green turtle (Chelonia mydas) is the most common and feeds on the extensive sea grass beds found in shallow waters. Both green and hawksbill (Eretmochelys imbricata) turtles are known to nest on the beaches of UAE's main coast and islands.
Coral reefs and mangrove creeks are habitats for many marine creatures. These areas are important fish breeding grounds and feeding areas and they protect the shores from coastal erosion.
Damage to coastal developments, fishing nets, anchors and ignorant divers cause destruction of these areas. Coral reefs are sensitive to their environment. They take decades to regrow.
Dominant marine life forms in the UAE coasts include fish, marine mammals and marine reptiles.

Fish
At the entrance to the Arabian Gulf, the constriction and resultant strong currents of the Strait of Hormuz, influence the distribution of many species.

Marine mammals
Marine mammals are relatively common in the UAE's waters and include a great diversity. The two groups of marine mammals that are represented here are the whales and dolphins of the order Cetacea, and  dugong of the order Sirenia.

Marine reptiles
These include sea turtles and sea snakes.

Sea turtles
Of the seven recognised species of marine turtles in the world, four live in the waters of the UAE. They are:
The olive ridley seaturtle( L epidochelys olivacea)

Sea Snakes
Sea Snakes are found in the UAE's seas. There are at least seven species, all of which belong to one family, the Hydrophiidae. They are excellent swimmers and the laterally flattened tail makes them easily recognisable and distinguishes them from eels.

The UAE's coasts
The UAE has two coastlines. The longer coast, at over 700 kilometres, excluding islands, faces in a north to north-westerly direction into the southern Arabian Gulf whilst the other, much shorter, coast, approximately 70 kilometres long, faces eastwards into the Gulf of Oman.
Much of the Arabian Gulf coastline is low-lying, flat and bordered by shallow water. While the coast of Gulf of Oman is rugged and eroding, with a higher proportion of hard rock.
The differences in climate along the two coasts has led to assemblages of marine organisms that are somewhat different, although both are of Indian Ocean origin.

Wetlands
The UAE has 10 sites designated as Wetlands of International Importance , Ramsar sites, with a surface area of 39,166 hectares. Some of these are:

Gheras
In order to preserve its biodiversity and protect and restore the natural habitats of its local plants, the UAE created a database of local plant species and made it available to the public. . An app titledGherasuae is available on App Store and Google Play .
In 2014, the UAE's Ministry of Climate Change and Environment  completed the first phase  of its date palm tree identification through DNA profiling through a collaboration with the UAE University.
The projects aims to offer all kinds of support to preserve, identify and classify all genetic assets of date palm trees. It also aims to establish a reference database for all types of palm trees found in the UAE, as well as identify and document the extent of their diversity. The project will also help increase the contribution of palm tree planting and date production to the country's gross domestic product.
In addition, many initiatives were launched to preserve the UAE's plant species, including the establishment of 'gene' banks for plants' genetic resources. One initiative will be implemented by Environment Agency - Abu Dhabi (EAD), which is set to document and preserve plants through establishing Abu Dhabi Plant Genetics Resources Centre. The purpose of the centre is to collect and document native plants so that if any species became extinct in the wild it could be cultivated in captivity and reintroduced back to nature.
The other is being undertakenat the UAE University in collaboration with the Khalifa Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology.

Popular searchesThe UAE efforts in the field of energy aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix and double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency.
The energy sector plays an important role in shaping the UAE's internal and external policies. Since the discovery of oil and gas more than half a century ago, the UAE became a central player in global hydrocarbon energy market.
The UAE is the fifth largest oil producer in OPEC, with an oil output of 2.79 million barrels per day (bpd) in 2013. In the same year, the production of natural gas amounted to around 54.60 billion cubic metres.

The demand for electricity and water continues to grow at a fast pace due to a rise in population, an expanding economy and climatic considerations.According to The UAE State of Energy Report 2015 (PDF), the share of power generation from gas will drop from 98 per cent in 2012 to less than 76 per cent in 2021 as clean energy would enter the mix and energy efficiency would intensify.

The UAE has decided to diversify its energy mix in order to sustain its progress and at the same time minimise the environmental impact that may arise from burning fuel.Therefore, it was decided that the traditional sources of energy, being oil and gas should not be the main drivers of the economic process. In addition, the UAE is developing local expertise in these important technologies and fostering international cooperation and resource conservation.
While oil and gas have historically been the dominant fuels powering the UAE's economy, the UAE's energy sector is undergoing a transformation targeting the diversification of the UAE's energy mix.
The UAE generates most of its electricity (110 billion kilowatt-hours in 2013) using natural gas-fired generation. It is planning to integrate the natural gas distribution networks of all the emirates; this should help alleviate some of the peak-demand shortfalls experienced in the past.
In 2012, the total installed capacity of electricity generation was 27.2 gigawatts (GW). To meet the rising demand in a sustainable manner, the UAE is focusing on coming up with a balanced energy mix.
The UAE Energy Strategy 2050 -(PDF, 67.9 MB) targets an energy mix that combines renewable, nuclear and clean energy sources to meet the UAE’s economic requirements and environmental goals as follows:
The UAE government aims to invest AED 600 billion by 2050 to meet the growing energy demand and ensure a sustainable growth for the country’s economy.
The Energy Trilemma Index ranks countries in terms of their potential ability to provide sustainable energy through the three dimensions:
In 2017, the overall rank of the UAE in this index was 40 and the balance score was AAD.
The UAE scored 21 in energy security, 14 in energy equity and 116 in environmental sustainability.

As part of Dubai Clean Energy Strategy to generate 75 per cent of Dubai's power from clean energy by 2050, Dubai will build the largest Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) project on a single site in the world, which is expected to begin power generation within the next five years.
The project will surpass the existing world's largest CSP tower in Morocco that has a power generating capacity of 150MW.
The new CSP project, will deliver inexpensive power at less than 8 US cents per kilowatt-hour as it is generated from the site to be located at the existing Mohammad Bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park.
Circular rings of solar mirrors called heliostats will direct sunlight into a central collection tower where the sun’s rays would power a steam turbine to generate concentrated solar power.

The solar project and solar park when completed are expected to slash carbon emissions in Dubai by more than 6.5 million tonnes of harmful CO2, helping Dubai and the UAE meet their commitment to the Paris Agreement to keep global warming temperature increases below 2 degrees Celsius this century.
The benefit of using concentrated solar power is that it can be stored for 8 to 12 hours after generation, which can help power the emirate through the night. The first phase of the new CSP project should be operational by 2021.

The emirate of Dubai announced in January 2012 that a 1 GW Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park would be built in phases and completed by 2030 in Seih Al Dahal, around 50 km south of Dubai city, to meet its renewable energy supply target.
The Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum Solar Park is the largest single-site solar park in the world, based on the IPP model. It will generate 1,000 MW by 2020 and 5,000 MW by 2030.The first phase of this project began operations in 2013 with a capacity of 13 MW. The second phase began operations in April 2017 with a capacity of 200 MW. The third phase will begin operations in 2020 with a capacity of 1,000 MW, while the fourth phase of the project will begin operations by the last quarter of 2020 with a capacity of 5,000 MW. The project will have the world’s tallest solar tower, measuring 260 metres.
This project was launched under the Dubai Clean Energy Strategy 2050 to increase the share of clean energy in Dubai’s total power output to 7 percent by 2020, 25 percent by 2030 and 75 percent by 2050.
This plant can be responsible for the reduction of approximately 15,000 tons of carbon dioxide annually. The park is expected to eventually cover 40 square kilometres. A 200 MW plant, part of the same complex, is currently under construction. The park will produce 5,000 MW by 2030.

Waste-to-energy is the process of generating energy in the form of electricity or heat from the primary treatment of waste.
Masdar, Abu Dhabi's renewable energy company, had signed a strategic partnership agreement with Bee'ah  to develop the UAE's waste-to-energy (WtE) sector. This partnership will help contribute to the UAE Government's Vision 2021 which targets, among other goals, diverting waste from landfills by 75 per cent by 2021.

In Abu Dhabi
A 100 MW facility, one of the world's largest, is under development in  Abu Dhabi by Abu Dhabi National Energy  Company PJSC (Taqa) , in coordination with Abu DhabiWaste Management Center (Tadweer).
The plant was scheduled to be up and running by 2017, generating enough power for 20,000 households in Abu Dhabi as well as cutting greenhouse gases. It is expected to reduce CO2 emissions by more than one million ton per year.
The project will be set near the Mussafah Sea Port, and it will be one of the biggest waste-to-energy facilities in the world, stretching across an area of 100,000 square metres.

In Dubai
By the second quarter of 2020, Dubai will have the largest plant in the Middle East to convert waste-to-energy. The plant will be located in Al Warsan 2 and will be built at a cost of AED 2 billion.
The project is in line with Dubai Municipality's vision to make Dubai the most sustainable and smart city by 2021, which will in turn achieve National Agenda's objectives for a 75 per cent reduction in the number of landfills by 2021.
This will provide more land plots that are currently being used to store waste, in addition to protecting the environment from methane emitted by landfills.
The plant will begin its operations by the second quarter of 2020, and that it will be able to process 2,000 metric tonnes every day during the first phase of operations, producing 60 megawatts of energy.
Dubai Municipality, in co-ordination with the Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, conducts studies to achieve the strategy of Dubai for Clean Energy, to produce 7 per cent of Dubai's total energy from clean energy sources by 2020.


In Sharjah
The emirate of Sharjah set up a municipal waste management company Bee'ah (the Arabic word for environment) in 2007 in the form of a public-private partnership. In October 2011, Sharjah announced an ambitious plan for 100 per cent landfill diversion by 2015.
To attain this goal, Bee'ah developed a state-of-the-art waste management centre to process and recycle waste. In 2012, the company introduced two-stream waste collection and a new tipping fee structure to incentivise waste reduction and to closely regulate landfill contents. Improved blue and green coloured odour-proof bins have been deployed across the emirate.
In addition, Sharjah is constructing a Waste-to-Energy (WtE) plant in in Sajja area that will eventually convert 400,000 tonnes of waste per year into 80 megawatts (MW) of electricity.
The project will convert 99 per cent of organic waste into energy. After using some of the generated power for the plant's own needs, the electricity will be exported to Sharjah.

In Ras Al Khaimah
The Energy from Waste Program of the RAK Energy Efficiency and Renewables Strategy 2040 integrates seamlessly into the broader waste management strategy of Ras Al Khaimah. It focuses on promoting energy outcomes for the available waste, targeting at least 2% of the primary energy demand of Ras Al Khaimah to be fulfilled from waste by 2040.
The Energy from Waste Program is planned in two phases:
1) An initial phase of studies and pilots (2018 – 2020), when various diversion options and energy outcomes are explored for different waste streams and the best options are selected
2) A subsequent phase of implementation (2021 onwards), when the waste treatment options selected in the first phase are implemented.

The above equation requires careful revision of the consumption tariff from time to time, or to apply the slab tariff system. The slab tariff encourages consumers to stay within the scope of the least costly slab rather than increasing consumption to avoid the more expensive slabs.
In order to promote efficient consumption of electricity and water, an additional fuel fee is added to consumers' monthly electricity and water bill. This fee depends on the rate of increase or decrease of the actual fuel cost supplied to DEWA's generation plants.
Efficiency standards and specifications require an increase in capital expenditure to cover the sums required to purchase applications or introduce improvements that help to reduce consumption.

According to UAE State of Energy Report 2015 , residents use about 550 litres of water and 20 to 30 kilowatt-hours of electricity a day and as the economy grows, the demand for energy is expected to increase by 9 per cent annually. Electricity demand in the UAE had reached 105 billion kilowatt hours in 2013, placing the UAE among the highest electricity consumers per capita in the world. The demand for electric power was matched by an increase in the number of power plants and their installed capacities. The installed capacities of power plants had increased by 54 per cent during 2007-2012.

On 2 March 2011, Sheikh Khalifa bin Zayed had announced an investment of AED 5.7 billion to the water and electricity sector in the northern areas of the country. He directed the Department of Energy in Abu Dhabi  to export electricity and water to Etihad Water and Electricity , who in turn would supply the same to the northern areas of the UAE. Electricity and water exported by Abu Dhabi doubled from 2008 to reach 13.664 gigawatt hours of exports.

Between 2008 and 2012, electricity capacity grew by 37 per cent, with Dubai increasing capacity by 44.5 percent and Abu Dhabi by 43.6 per cent. In 2012, the total installed capacity reached 27,180 megawatts. At present, there are over 27 gigawatts (GW) of installed capacity to generate electricity across the seven emirates utilising natural gas, which is the cleanest fossil fuel available. The UAE is looking at increasing its target for generating power from clean energy to 27 per cent by 2021.

The National Water and Energy Demand Management Programme targets 40 per cent efficiency of the three most energy-consuming sectors in the UAE : transport, industry and construction.
The programme includes three main pillars : Energy, water and consumption rationalisation.
The UAE has limited natural water resources. It uses thermal desalination as the dominant technology to make seawater potable. Today, most of the country's potable water (42 per cent of the total water requirement) comes from some 70 major desalination plants, which account for around 14 per cent of the world's total production of desalinated water.
Due to lack of freshwater sources, it is important for the UAE to identify a sustainable desalination solution to meet long-term water needs. Connecting desalination technologies to renewable energy is one solution.
The water consumed in the UAE is mainly desalinated, dependent on electricity in case of reverse osmosis, or a by-product of electricity generation through multiple-effect distillation (MED) and multiple-stage flash distillation (MSF).
According to State of Energy Report 2015, the demand for water grew largely at a rate of 35.8 percent from 2008 to 2012. The installed capacity for desalinated and groundwater reached 1,585 million imperial gallons per day, while water production was 393,878 million imperial gallons per year.
Some of the desalination plants in the UAE include:

The UAE has paid great attention to dams and rainwater harvesting projects. Dams contribute to protection from floods and flow risks and improve the quality and quantity of the water situation in the aquifer by increasing the feeding rates of groundwater.
Dams in the UAE include:
The dam is located in the northern part of Ras Al Khaimah (RAK) in Al Beeh Wadi. It is constructed to feed the underground water. It supplies water to Al Burairat and Al Hamraniya in RAK.
The dam is located in the Masfout region in Wadi Ghalfa, a middle agricultural region and is constructed to feed the underground water.
The dam is located in the eastern agricultural region of the UAE, Wadi Wareaa. It slopes from Masafi hill and pours into Gulf of Oman. It is constructed to feed the groundwater and protect the area from floods. It feeds the areas of Al Badiya and Khor Fakkan.
The dam is located in the eastern agricultural region of the UAE, in Wadi Basira. It is constructed to feed the groundwater areas in Dibba and protect the area from floods.
It is located in the eastern region of the UAE in Fujairah and is constructed to feed the underground water, protect the area from floods and enhance water quality. The dam feeds the local areas in Fujairah and Kalba.
It is considered as a small dam which impounds water and mitigates its speed. It is located in the northern agricultural region in Wadi Azan and constructed to feed the underground water. It feeds Azan and Al Hamraniyah areas.
It is located in the northern region in Wadi Al Ghail. It is constructed to supply irrigation water for Al Ghail area and feed the underground water.
The UAE saves no effort in expanding international cooperation and capacity-building support to developing countries in water and sanitation-related activities and programmes, including water harvesting, desalination, water efficiency, wastewater treatment, recycling and reuse technologies.

Popular searchesEfforts in waste management in the UAE include converting waste to energy, treating wastewater and controlling the movement of hazardous waste.
Due to population growth and economic activities, the quantities of wastes in the UAE have increased in the last decade. Most of the waste ends up in municipal landfills or dumpsites, where organic waste generates a large amount of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. Currently, little of the waste is burnt and the rate of municipal waste recycling has been rapidly rising.
Waste management in the country is coordinated through local authorities. Waste issues are handled through recycling and converting waste to energy and resources, new technologies and improved waste separation and collection systems. The UAE aims to reduce the adverse per capita environmental impact of cities, including by paying special attention to air quality and municipal and other waste management.
The UAE issued Cabinet Resolution No. (39) regarding the executive regulations of Federal Resolution No. (12) of 2018 on the integrated waste management that seeks to regulate the waste management process and standardize the mechanisms and methods of proper waste disposal in line with best practices with the aim of protecting the environment and reducing risks to human health.
Waste management in Abu Dhabi
The Government of Abu Dhabi established the Centre of Waste Management Tadweer in 2008.  The company is responsible for the policy, strategy and contractual systems of waste management across the emirate.
Waste management in Dubai
Dubai Municipality's Waste Management Department prepared the Dubai Integrated Waste Management Master Plan in 2012 with an aim to reduce the amount of waste being sent to the landfills to zero in 20 years by using an integrated and innovative approach.
Dubai Municipality has announced that it will establish the largest plant in the Middle East to convert solid waste into energy at a cost of AED 2 billion in the Warsan district. The move also comes in line with the National Agenda to reduce the landfill by 75 per cent by 2021, in addition to protecting the environment from methane gas emitted by the landfill. The implementation period will take three years and the plant will be operational in the second quarter of 2020 during which it will receive 2,000 metric tonnes of municipal solid waste per day in the first phase to produce 60 megawatts. The waste incineration project is the first of the four projects to produce green energy.
Dubai Municipality, in co-ordination with Dubai Supreme Council of Energy and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority, conducted studies to achieve the strategy of Dubai for Clean Energy, to produce 7 per cent of Dubai's total energy from clean energy sources by 2020.

The flaring of natural gas as a by-product of oil production wastes contributes to severe air pollution and GHG emissions.
The UAE has succeeded in reducing flaring of natural gas from the oil and gas industry since the 1990s and its policy is shifting from minimal flaring to zero-tolerance.
Abu Dhabi National Oil Company (ADNOC) group aims to eliminate routine flaring and had reduced flaring by 76.4 per cent in 2013.
Within the ADNOC group, an offshore exploration and production (E&P) company has already achieved zero flaring at its Zakum oilfields for the first time.
Onshore, an ADNOC gas E&P company developed a flare management strategy for its Shah Gas Development Project, with the aim of minimising flaring from well-testing and clean-up operations.
Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar) has accumulated knowledge on formulating policies and projects to reduce flaring and has been serving as a partner of the World Bank's Global Gas Flaring Reduction Partnership since 2009.
To share its advanced experiences of flaring reduction, Abu Dhabi has been hosting the annual Flare Management and Reduction Summit since 2012.
These include various techniques to enhance oil extraction such as enhanced oil recovery (EOR) methods that help inject natural gas contained in old reservoirs to add pressure and boost output.
Another technique is carbon capture and storage (CCS) that helps enhance oil recovery and slow down the pace of climate change.
In 2013, ADNOC set up a joint venture with Abu Dhabi Future Energy Company (Masdar) to implement carbon capture and storage projects by which, 800,000 tonnes of CO2 emitted annually from Emirates Steel's plant will be piped 50 km to onshore oilfields to enhance oil recovery.
Abu Dhabi Ports and Khalifa Industrial Zone (Kizad) announced the launch of construction activities of  National Food Product Company(NFPC) in a 752,000-sq metre production facility in Kizad. The factory will be an energy-saving facility and one of the first fully automated one in the world.
The first phase of the NFPC facility with energy and water saving features will comprise a 5-gallon water bottling plant, a dairy, a juice and small water bottling plant under one roof.
The second phase of the project will comprise a fully automated packaging factory producing tailored containers for the food industry, a modern recycling plant to manufacture products using waste materials and the largest fully automated cold store.
Dubai Aluminium (Dubal) and  Emirates Aluminium (Emal), which were merged into Emirates Global Aluminium (EGA) in 2013, introduced a co-generation and combined cycle configuration in their power stations, achieving 46-48 per cent thermal efficiency.
According to UAE State of Green Economy Report 2014 ,Dubai's greenhouse gas (GHG) intensity in production was reduced by 12 per cent in five years.
The UAE aims to upgrade infrastructure and make industries sustainable, with increased resource-use efficiency and greater adoption of clean and environmentally sound technologies and industrial processes.
Natural gas is a viable cleaner alternative fuel to gasoline as it produces fewer emissions and the running cost of vehicles is around 30 per cent less.
ADNOC's gas processing and fuel distribution subsidiaries are leading the way to expand the use of the compressed natural gas (CNG) for vehicles by investing in the infrastructure to ensure that there are enough filling stations to support additional demand for such vehicles.
The first phase of the Natural Gas for Vehicles (NGV) project involves the installation of CNG pumps at 16 stations in Abu Dhabi and Al Ain as well as in the emirate of Sharjah, with a capacity to fill 10,000 vehicles per day.
In Dubai, Emirates Gas (EMGAS), an ENOC subsidiary, started an initiative to popularise CNG as an automotive fuel in 2006. Moreover, more than 3,000 public transport vehicles have been adapted to run on CNG.
In addition, a pilot project was conducted with Dubai's Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) that converted diesel-operated wooden abras (water taxis) running on the Dubai creek to operate on CNG.
In addition, CNG is introduced to fleet users such as Dubai Municipality, DP World, Emirates Group, Transguard and Dubai Electricity and Water Authority (DEWA) among others.

Green diesel
In July 2014, the UAE became the first country in the Middle East to make use of 'green diesel' in all commercial diesel vehicles mandatory. The new Cabinet decree and the updated guidelines from Emirates Authority for Standardization and Metrology (ESMA) requires replacement of the diesel fuel that contains 500 parts per million (ppm) of sulphur with diesel fuel that contains only 10 ppm similar to Euro 5 standards. This reduction in sulphur levels will significantly reduce particulate matters (PM) and pollutants and contribute to cleaner and healthier environment.
Introducing green service stations
ENOC introduced the first ' green service station' in the Emirates Hills neighbourhood in Dubai. This station applies a variety of state-of-the-art technologies and features including:
The station generates half of its energy requirements from renewable sources as it uses solar-powered pole and light-emitting diode (LED) lights. Diverse sustainable water features have been installed to reduce water use by a quarter.
It uses sensor water taps and two-stage flush systems in the toilets and recycles carwash water while also providing customers the option to use a waterless carwash system with an all-in-one eco-friendly liquid.

Clean fossil fuels
Carbon capture and storage (CCS) is a means of mitigating climate change by capturing carbon dioxide (CO2) from large point sources such as power plants and storing it safely underground instead of releasing it into the atmosphere.
The potential impact of CCS is huge. The Intergovernmental Panel on climate change expects that CCS could contribute between 10 and 55 per cent of the cumulative worldwide carbon mitigation effort over the next 90 years.
The UAE is developing a major CCS project in Abu Dhabi, which is managed by Al Reyadah: Abu Dhabi Carbon Capture Company. It is the first in a planned series of CCUS projects in the emirate of Abu Dhabi. The source of CO2 for this Project is an off stream from Emirates Steel Industries (ESI) factory in Mussafah, UAE.
Demand-side management (DSM) focuses on reducing and optimising energy consumption as an additional option to meet network demand. DSM activities generally comprise a portfolio of policies and programmes for improving energy efficiency and demand response.
At the core of this demand-side approach is the introduction of smart metres that can provide more precise information about energy use and ensure faster responses to changing supply and demand through automatic reconnections.
In Abu Dhabi, the Department of Energy launched a DSM programme defining a holistic energy efficiency strategy that ensures a shift towards the development of a smart grid that will support the future needs of the society.
It has completed an implementation roadmap for the programme and has already made significant progress in rolling out advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) over 400,000 of the existing 680,000 consumer points in the municipalities of Abu Dhabi and Al Ain.
AMI collects consumption data remotely via smart metres, which is validated and transferred through data management systems to its customer billing system.
In Dubai, as the emirate set a target of 30 per cent reduction in energy demand by 2030 as a key objective of the Dubai Integrated Energy Strategy 2030, DEWA has developed a DSM roadmap and action plan over the short, medium and long-term to 2030.
These include 8 DSM programmes and 24 initiatives covering all the potential saving areas and include cost-benefit analysis, implementation and financing mechanisms and measurement and verification methodology.
In addition, DEWA replaced conventional metres with 200,000 smart metres all over Dubai.
The UAE is a leader in adopting district cooling systems (DCS) as the preferred alternative to conventional air conditioning. In general, DCS consume 50 per cent less energy than the conventional systems. A number of district cooling utility companies have emerged and more than one in ten residents now use the systems.
In 2010, the UAE Cabinet approved the Green Building and Sustainable Building standards to be applied across the country. Application of these standards started in government buildings early 2011.
The project is expected to save AED 10 billion by 2030 and reduce around 30 per cent of carbon emissions.
Abu Dhabi introduced the five-level  Estidama  Pearl Rating System. It is mandatory for all new buildings to obtain a one-pearl rating, while all government buildings and residential villas must obtain two pearls.
Dubai introduced the green building regulations containing 79 specifications, which is now mandatory for all developments.

Rent rates depends on the location and size of the property to be rented. Tenants can pay the rent in one payment or through multiple payments as agreed with the broker/landlord.

In addition, some brokers may require a commission fee, up to 5 per cent of the total amount of rent.

To conclude a lease contract with the landlord and/or real estate agent, the tenant must provide identification documents which include a copy of his passport, a valid residence visa and Emirates ID, in addition to post-dated cheques covering payments for the agreed lease period.
Lease agreements between landlords and tenants must be registered by the respective authority in each emirate. Registration of lease contracts is compulsory to connect the utility services needed for the rented property. This includes water, electricity and gas and telecommunications services .

In Abu Dhabi, landlords have to register lease contract in the Tawtheeq system, which is the city’s register for tenancy contracts. Once the lease contract has been registered, a housing fee of 3 per cent of the value of the annual rent will be levied equally across 12 months. This amount will be added to the monthly water and electricity bill of the tenant.

This page provides information about how Ramadan is observed in the UAE, charitable activities conducted and common changes one experiences during Ramadan in the UAE.
Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar. It is regarded as the holiest month of the year as it was the month in which the Quran was revealed to Prophet Mohammad (peace be upon him) on the night of Laylat Al Qadr, one of the last ten nights of Ramadan.
Ramadan is the month of piety, charity and blessings. During Ramadan, capable Muslims are required to abstain from eating and drinking from dawn to dusk. Such fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam.
Like other months, Ramadan too begins at the first sighting of the new crescent moon and lasts 29 or 30 days depending on the sighting of the next crescent. The UAE follows an official announcement in this regard from the moon-sighting committee in Makkah, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia as Makkah is considered the holiest city in the Islamic world. It is the birthplace of Prophet Mohammad (PBUH) and also the location where he had his first revelation of the Quran.
The Islamic calendar has 354 days. Hence, Ramadan arrives 11 days earlier in every subsequent year of the Gregorian calendar. People greet each other by saying 'Ramadan Kareem', which means 'Happy Ramadan'.



The Ramadan traditions in the UAE start mid-Shaaban (the month preceding Ramadan). This day is known as Hagg Al-Layla. Emirati children dress in their best clothes and go to houses in the neighbouring areas reciting songs and poems. The neighbours welcome them with sweets and nuts, which is collected by children in traditional cloth bags.

There are two main meals in Ramadan: Suhoor and Iftar. Suhoor is consumed early in the morning before sunrise, just before fasting hours start. Iftar is the meal to break the fast. Following the example of the Prophet Muhammad, fasting is broken with dates and laban (buttermilk) throughout the Islamic world.

On the first night of Ramadan, the family gathers at the house of the male head of the family, usually the grandfather, for their first Iftar. In the UAE and the other GCC countries, dates are considered as the 'bread of the desert'. Gars, a bread-like crumble with dates and cardamom, is a popular Emirati sweet dish during Ramadan. Other common dishes are Harees and Threed. Read about where you can eat Emirati food .




Firing the cannon (Midfa Al Iftar) is an integral part of the Islamic culture and takes place in many regions across the country. It can be heard around 8-10 km away. It signals the moment when Muslims can break their fast. This tradition is known to people since the rule of the late Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan, the Founder President of the UAE. Children wait for the sound of the big bang. To them, Iftar cannon is the most fun thing that happens during this month, apart from the sweets and other special meals and activities arranged for them. Members of the UAE military carry out this tradition with appropriate safety precautions.

Those who suffer certain barrier such as illness or pregnancy are not obligated to fast as per health professionals' advice. Those who were travelling may fast later. Children are not required to fast until they have reached puberty, although many still do out of choice. In addition to abstaining from eating, drinking and smoking, Muslims also should refrain from sinful speech and behaviour.

In addition to the regular 5 daily prayers, Muslim men and women perform Tarawih prayers daily after Isha prayers in mid-evening. During the last ten days, many devoted Muslims spend the whole day in mosques, praying and reciting the Quran, in anticipation of the Laylat Al Qadr, the night of the first revelation of the Quran. Reciting different chapters each day from the Quran is appreciated throughout the month of Ramadan. Observing Ramadan provides a spiritual experience. It is the time for Muslims to practice self-discipline, sacrifice and empathy for the less fortunate. It encourages generosity and charity.

Charitable activities
Ramadan is a time for charity; giving to the less fortunate will be greatly appreciated. It doesn't have to be money, but perhaps food for Iftar. Providing free Iftar meals is a common practice across the UAE. Meals are provided at mosques, malls and other public places.

Red Crescent Authority (RCA) and Khalifa bin Zayed Al Nahyan Foundation and other charitable organisations set up tents in various locations in the UAE to offer free Iftar meals. Setting up Ramadan tents is a fundamental practice in the UAE's tradition. It reflects the spirit of giving and sharing with people from different nationalities, social status and financial backgrounds who sit together to break their fast. Tents are usually seen near mosques, in open spaces and at the entrances of some Emiratis' houses. One can experience Emirati hospitality and traditions at these tents.

Many public and private organisations distribute boxes of meals, dates and water at mosques and malls daily shortly before Iftar time. They also provide foodstuff (called Al Mir Al Ramadani) to cater to the poor.

RCA provides Ramadan supplies, distributes Zakat Al Fitr and Eid clothing to deserving families in the UAE and abroad. Individuals, companies and organisations interested in contributing to Red Crescent Society can do so through their counters located at mosques, shopping malls, hospitals and other public places.


You can donate clothes and money through registered charitable organisations by depositing them in designated boxes located at various public places. During Ramadan, many organisations set up tents near co-operative supermarkets for receiving donations.
